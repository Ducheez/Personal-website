    Bonjour! My name is Vanessa, I am a five months old adult who is basically figuring out a lot about her very own life.
    I was born and raised in <strong>Kenya, Nairobi </strong>to be more specific. I love art and photography and believe that art is long, life is short!
    I also enjoy coding and spending time with friends and family. I am an ambiverted girl who can yap a lot and in other crowds be reserved.
    Currently life is moving so fast and I'm just trying to keep up.
     I believe that at some point in my life I will be affluent and an infliential woman in <em>STEM</em> That day is coming and coming fast. <em>BRACE YOURSELVES</em>
